> "Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) should be viewed as essential tools, akin to the finely tuned parts of a Formula 1 car. The act of problem-solving with DSA serves as a crucial platform to exhibit both intelligence and creative thinking. The coding challenges themselves are simply various permutations of external factors; like the weather, track, wind, and rain in an F1 race. Ultimately, what dictates success in both domains; coding and Formula 1; is the mastery of planning, strategizing, maintaining flow, and ensuring precise code orchestration." - Siddhant Bali
